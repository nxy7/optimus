Multilingual monorepo framework. The goal of this project is providing framework that's language agnostic, supports caching test results, allows describing services test, build and deploy processes regardless of project structure (standalone app/docker compose/kubernetes). 

# Goals
- easily understandable and extendable configuration
- caching test results if part of the project did not change
- rigid and opinionated project structure
- allow easy reusing of other existing apps/languages knowledge

# Example configurations

## Standalone App

## Docker Compose

## Kubernetes

# How to install
The easiest way to install this software would be using output of the flake from this repo and that's primarily how I'm using it in my other projects.
